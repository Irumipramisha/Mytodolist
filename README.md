# My Interactive Todo List

This is a simple, clean, and functional **Todo List application** built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I created this project to manage daily tasks efficiently while learning how to use **Local Storage** in the browser.

## Live Demo
You can check out the live version here:

## Features
* **Add Tasks:** Quickly add new things to do.
* **Mark as Done:** Click the "Done" button to strike through completed tasks.
* **Delete Tasks:** Remove tasks you no longer need.
* **Data Persistence:** Uses **Local Storage**, so your tasks won't disappear even if you refresh the page!
* **Responsive Design:** Works on both mobile and desktop screens.

## Technologies Used
* **HTML5:** For the structure.
* **CSS3:** For styling and layout.
* **JavaScript (ES6):** For the logic and local storage integration.

## Project Structure
* `index.html` - The main entry point.
* `style.css` - Stylesheet for the modern UI.
* `script.js` - Logic for adding, deleting, and saving tasks.
